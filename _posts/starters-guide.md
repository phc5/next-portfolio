## Step 0: Congratulate yourself! You are making a big and positive change!

By taking this first step, you are setting yourself up for future successs. Recognize that this journey you are about to embark on is not taken by most people and by being here and reading this, you are ahead of the curve!

## Step 1: Build a budget and set realistic goals.

You need to know where your money is being spent in order to have a firm financial foundation. Creating a budget helps you see where your money is coming IN from and where your money is going OUT to.

There are certain expenses that are harder to reduce or eliminate such as housing and utilities, but by creating a budget you can find areas to improve on including but not limited to eating out, various subscriptions (i.e Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, etc...), car payments, or clothing expenses.

There are various tools (free or paid) that you can use to track your expenses and income. Here are some tools:

- <a href="https://www.youneedabudget.com/">YNAB (You Need a Budget)</a>
- <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/">Personal Capital</a>
- Your own spreadsheet (Excel, Google Sheets)

This is your budget and you can set it up however you like. Most people budget for a month's worth of expenses but if you want to get granular you can create one for a weekly basis or whenever you get your paycheck.

## Step 2: Build an Emergency Fund

The next step is to have a blanket of financial security: an emergency fund. This fund (we will call it E-Fund) should be a liquid amount of money that should only be used in emergency situations such as medical procedures, car problems, house problems, or job loss.

You should aim for 3-6 months of expenses (taken from your budget in Step 1). This range will differ from person to person. You will have to figure out your risk tolerance and what you are comfortable with. A question to ask yourself is "If I lose my job or source of income, how long would I be comfortable without that source of income?" or "How long would it take me to find another job?".

There are edge cases to the 3-6 month requirement. If you have high amount of high interest debt. It may be more sensible to pay those off more aggressively than to save up 6 months of expenses in an E-Fund. The logic behind this is that the money sitting in your E-Fund is getting 1.5-2% interest while your debt is at a higher interest rate such as 10-15%. You could plan to have 1-2 months of E-Fund and then start to aggresively pay off those high interest debts.

Remember that this E-Fund is suppposed to be liquid, meaning you can gain access to the money when you need it (almost immediately). The most common choices for holding E-Funds are in FDIC-insured high-yield savings/checking accounts or CDs. There are a plethora of banks and credit unions that offer better rates for savings/checkings over bigger banks like Chase and BofA.

You should not store your emergency fund in stocks or anything with high risk. This fund is meant to be a safety net and accessible any time. Introducing any risk will negate the fact that it is an emergency fund.

## Step 3: Take Advantage of Employer Sponsored Retirement Plan

After creating a budget and E-Fund, the next step is to enroll in your employer-sponsored retirement plan. This applies to retirement plans where your employer contributes money towards your plan: a contribution match. Every employer has a different plan and match but the main idea here is that you want to contribute at least the employer match to get "free" money.

How this works is employers match a certain percentage of what you contribute to your retirement plan. For example, if the employer's 401(k) match is 100% of 6%, they will match 100% of your contributions up to 6%. Taking this further, if I make $100,000 dollars a year and contribute 6% ($6,000), my employer will match and also contribute $6,000 dollars to my 401(k). If I contributed only $3,000, my employer would only contribute \$3,000. As you can see, it is ideal to contribute up to the match at the very least, if possible.

This is a good time to also talk about pre-tax deductions. When contributing to a retirement account like the traditional 401(k), the amount you contribute is deducted (subtracted) from your taxable income. If I made $100,000 a year and contributed 15%, my taxable income would be reduced to $85,000 which effectively lowers how much taxes I pay and could put you in a lower tax bracket.

If your employer does not match or have a plan, you should move on to step 4 and eliminate high interest debt.

If you are self-employed, you can also make your own employer contributions to your 401(k) or SIMPLE IRA, but you should do this as part of step 5.
