I recently (6/22/2020) accepted a front end engineering position at AWS Activate and wanted to reflect on my time at Kelley Blue Book, talk a little about the interview process for AWS, and jot down what I look forward to in my new position.

## My Time at Kelley Blue Book

I graduated from Calvin College in 2016 and took some time in between graudation and KBB to travel and learn web development online. My first day at KBB was on May 15th, 2020 and my first impression of the team was how friendly and welcoming everyone was; this is still the KBB.com culture today despite working in a virtual world. I had come in without knowing how engineering fits within the business and how software engineers operate on a day-to-day basis and was eased into becoming a solid individual contributer.

KBB was a blessing not only because it was 5 minutes away from my home, but also because it opened so many doors for me. When I first started working at KBB, we were in a monolithic architecture using .NET and Vanilla JS. A year later, we had transitioned into a microservice architecture and worked with technologies like .NET, React.js, AWS, and GraphQL. I got to learn about the differences between these two architectures and got to learn and work with the latest technologies all within the short three years I was there.

KBB also provided me with various learning opportunities through resources like Pluralsight, onsite trainings, hackathons, and conferences. I even got the opportunity to go to re:Invent 2019; I was one of a few engineers that were selected to attend re:Invent. I got to spend a full work-week attending talks and workshops, networking, and exploring Las Vegas! I even won a Nintendo Switch by winning a competition at a vendor booth.

All in all, my time at KBB was positive: I learned alot and had memorable experiences.

## Interiewing at Amazon

I was not actively looking for a job when I applied to AWS. I had actually found this job posting while scrolling on LinkedIn one night and read up on AWS Activate and what it was all about. At its core, Activate provides startups with various benefits, technical support, and training to help startups and businesses grow. This description fit very well with the things that I was doing on the side with my friend at the time: an application that helps startups formulate their ideas into reality. So I got very excited and put together my application for this position and hoped for the best!

After submitting my application to Activate, I also applied to various other companies and institutions like Blend, Twitch, and NASA ADS. Back in 2017 when I was applying for jobs, I just casted a very wide net and put out my resume/application to as many roles as possible. This time around, however, with the benefit of having a current job and more experience, I found myself applying to positions that I really wanted and for products that believed in. I used my old job tracker spreadsheet to keep track of the jobs that I applied to and had only applied to 6 positions this time around. Back in 2017, I had applied to over 100 jobs before I accepted an offer.

Here's a quick timeline of my interview process at Amazon:

1. May 13, 2020 - Applied for job
2. May 18, 2020 - Heard back from recruiter via email
3. May 20, 2020 - Recruiter phone screen (1hr)
4. May 28, 2020 - Technical phone screen (1hr)
5. June 16, 2020 - Onsite (5hr)
6. June 19, 2020 - Offer
7. June 22, 2020 - Accepted Offer

The process took a little over a month from submitting my application to accepting the offer and this probably varies from candidate to candidate. I felt this was a good timeline because I was able to have ample time to prepare for behavioral questions (Leadership Principles) and to study up on data structures & algorithms and front end related topics.

This interview process was definitely challenging but very rewarding not only because I got the offer but also because it helped me reflect as an engineer and individual on what I value.
